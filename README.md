# superkeys


this one allows you to add any number of samples for the same instrument - the closest one in pitch will be used. you can also add velocity ranges for each instrument in the case you have a soft *and* loud sound for your instrument.

## todo

- [x] add timestretching? no
- [ ] load sounds dynamically (first time they are used), load and then play sound soon after
- [ ] if dynamic loading works, include ALL notes?
